In the same way that the \u201ccorporate directory\u201d feature of VoIP hardphones enables users to easily dial by name via their VoIP handsets, ACE was developed as a research idea born from \u201cVoIP Hopper\u201d to automate VoIP attacks that can be targeted against names in an enterprise Directory. The concept is that in the future, attacks will be carried out against users based on their name, rather than targeting VoIP traffic against random RTP audio streams or IP addresses. ACE works by using DHCP, TFTP, and HTTP in order to download the VoIP corporate directory. It then outputs the directory to a text file, which can be used as input to other VoIP assessment tools."

It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and official binary packages are available for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X. In addition to the classic command-line Nmap executable, the Nmap suite includes an advanced GUI and results viewer (Zenmap), a flexible data transfer, redirection, and debugging tool (Ncat), a utility for comparing scan results (Ndiff), and a packet generation and response analysis tool (Nping)."

This requires two important steps in order for the tool to traverse VLANs for unauthorized access.  First,  discovery of the correct 12 bit Voice VLAN ID (VVID) used by the IP Phones is required.  VoIP Hopper supports multiple protocol discovery methods (CDP, DHCP, LLDP-MED, 802.1q ARP) for this important first step.  Second, the tool creates a virtual VoIP ethernet interface on the OS.  It then inserts a spoofed 4-byte 802.1q vlan header containing the 12 bit VVID into a spoofed DHCP request.  Once it receives an IP address in the VoIP VLAN subnet, all subsequent ethernet frames are \u201ctagged\u201d with the spoofed 802.1q header.
